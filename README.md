## My Task For This Homework

To update my web application portfolio.

The goal of the portfolio is to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 

I need to add highlights to my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

I will be applying skills I recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
