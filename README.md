# My Portfolio

## My Task For This Homework

To create a web application from scratch. I'll build a portfolio page that can I add to as the bootcamp progresses. 

The goal of the portfolio is to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 

I need to add highlights to my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

I will be applying skills I recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
